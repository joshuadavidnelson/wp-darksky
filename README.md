# WP-DarkSky
A helper class for using darksky.net in WordPress. Requires a latitude, longitude, and Dark Sky API Key. It's set up to use a transient by default, refreshed every 6 hours, to limit the number of API calls made in a day (the first 1,000/day are free).

See more about the API in the [Dark Sky API Documentation](https://darksky.net/dev/docs).

### Notice: DarkSky API is closing ###
Dark Sky announced on March 31, 2020 that the company was acquired by Apple and the API is now closed to new signups. It will continue to be supported for existing accounts through the end of 2021. More information [here](https://blog.darksky.net/).

Due to these circumstances, this project will remain available until the API is phased out and then be put on archive status. No further support will be provided.

**Current Version:** 1.1.1

**Minimum PHP:** PHP 5.3.0

**Minimum WordPress:** 3.1.0

#### Arguments

There are a few arguments available with this class to extend it further. 

- `api_key` This is required, sign up for one at https://darksky.net/dev/register
- `latitude` Required.
- `longitude` Required.
- `time`	Optional. Pass a timestamp for the forecast at a specific time.
- `cache_prefix` The transient prefix, defaults to 'api_'. Note that the transient name is this prefix plus an [md5](http://php.net/manual/en/function.md5.php) on the request url, so you're limited to an 8 character limit on the prefix or the transient will not save.
- `cache_enabled`	Boolean, default to true.
- `cache_time` Time to store the transient in seconds, defaults to 6 hours.
- `clear_cache` Boolean, default false. Set to true to force the cache to clear.
- `query`	An array of url query arguments, refer to the Dark Sky API documentation.

#### Example

You can call this class and output the data of the response fairly easily. Here's an example of a call to get the current day's temperature.

```php
$args = array(
	'api_key' 	=> '', // Enter your API key
	'latitude'	=> '', // enter the longitude
	'longitude'	=> '', // enter the latitude
	'query'		=> array( 'units' => 'us', 'exclude' => 'flags' )
);
$forecast = new DarkSky\Forecast( $args );

// Get the current forecast data for the daily forecast, which provides the next 7 days
$daily = isset( $forecast->daily['data'] ) ? $forecast->daily['data'] : false;

// Pull out the current day's forecast
if( $daily ) {
	$date_format = 'n/j/Y';
	$time_now = date( $date_format, current_time( 'timestamp' ) );
	foreach( $daily as $day ) {
		if( isset( $day['time'] ) && $time_now == date( $date_format, $day['time'] ) ) {
			echo number_format( $day['temperatureMin'], 0 ) . ' / ' . number_format( $day['temperatureMax'], 0 );
			break;
		}
	}
}
```

The above will result with a min / max temperature forecast for the current day, similar to: 45 / 70 &deg;. You can take any element of the Forecast response in a similar fashion and output into your site.
